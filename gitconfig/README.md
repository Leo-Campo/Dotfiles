# GitConfig

My personal git configuration. This file sets up hook directories, pager, aliases and
much more used within git. It will automatically source, if present, a `.gitconfig_extra`
file to fine tune settings specific for each machine.

As pager I currently use [Delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta), a
syntax-highlighting pager for git, diff, and grep output
