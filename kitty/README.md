# [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)

A fast terminal emulator designed for keyboard power users.
Follow [this link](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/faq/#kitty-is-not-able-to-use-my-favorite-font)
to fix issues with Kitty and nerd fonts / ligatures.

## Configuration

My own kitty uses JetBrains Mono as font, enabling ligatures and
symbols map.

Kitti.config is used to set up every hotkey you may need,
working similary to Nvim with a special leader key.

Folke's _tokyonight_ theme is used as a base theme, with the
_storm_ variant, to ensure a consistent look and fell through all
my terminal sessions.
