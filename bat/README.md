# [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)

A cat clone with wings built in rust, offers colorization
and amazing speed out of the box.

Currently, I'm using Folke's _Tokyonight_ theme with
the _storm_ variant to ensure a consistent experience
throughout my terminal sessions.

Once themes are installed the first time, run `bat cache -b` to
rebuild the bat theme cache and have the theme available.
