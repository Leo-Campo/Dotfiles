# [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit#installation)

Another git client straight from the command line. Used by default in my current
lazyvim nvim configuration

## Configuration

The configuration file defines each and every keybind used inside
lazygit.

Folke's _tokyonight_ theme is used as a base theme, with the
_storm_ variant, to ensure a consistent look and fell through all
my terminal sessions.
