# [Starship](https://github.com/starship/starship)

Starship is a blazing fast and customizable shell prompt built in Rust.

Starship divides the prompt into components, each component showing information
on the underlying technology or environment based on certain conditions: i.e. showing
the python version used in a virtual
env folder, the node version used in a nodejs project, etc.

My configuration is taken from
[folke](https://github.com/folke/dot/) dotfile repo, with a couple
of adjustments.
