# [Ripgrep](https://github.com/behnam/rust-ripgrep)

A new, faster alternative to grep

In order to add your configuration,
set the environment variable `RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH` to the path of your configuration file.

In my own configuration, I've added a couple of file types
to quickly search web development or proto files using
the `-t` flag, as well as some default options.
