# Alacritty

[Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) is a GPU enhanced terminal emulator totally
configurable with toml files.

Configuration provided sets the font used and other sensible options. Tokyonight storm theme is included
to ensure cohesion with my current nvim theme and colors
