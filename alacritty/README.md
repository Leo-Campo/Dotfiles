# [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)

A cross-platform, OpenGL terminal emulator with
sensible defaults and broad configuration options.

Configuration provided sets the font used and other sensible options.
Tokyonight storm theme is included
to ensure cohesion with my current nvim theme and colors

## Configuration

My current configuration sets the font
used to [Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)
for regular and bold / italic styles, as well as
configurating a main keybinding to spawn new instances,
scrolling, shell and window options.

Currently I use Folke's _tokyonight_ theme, with the _Storm_ variant, to
ensure a consistent look and feel throughout all my terminal sessions.
