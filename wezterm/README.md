## Wezterm

[Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html) is an amazing terminal
emulator written in Rust and completely configurable in lua. It also comes with
multiplexer features out of the box, supporting panes, windows and tabs.

I've tinkered a bit with its configuration taking ideas from
[this](https://github.com/Aylur/dotfiles/tree/main) fellow developer dotfiles.
