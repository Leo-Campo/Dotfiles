# [Ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot)

A terminal based Spotify client

Some libs may be needed for this to work. If installation fails, install
missing dependencies using your package manager. In my case, I needed to run
`apt-get install libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev`

Configurations for ncspot will be placed in `$HOME/.config/ncspot/`

Themes can be browsed [here](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot/pull/40),
I'm using Folke's _tokyonight_ theme and
nerd fonts.
